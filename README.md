# energenie-standalone
EnergenieControl.exe is a standalone cli tool to control energenie EG-PMS2. 
It is written in C# and compiled to .exe using dotnet. 
I used the energenie provided SDK (PMDll.dll). If you want to change the code, you can change the `EnergenieControl/Program.cs` file.

Note: This was a quick chatgpt coded solution which works fine for me. I am not a C# developer.
## Dependencies

- Install the Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable (x86) to satisfy its side-by-side dependencies.Â

- Add PMDll.dll to PATH or have it in the same folder as the .exe
